## Hi, I'm Jaewon ðŸ‘‹

I'm a current senior at Columbia University studying Computer Science. Right now, I'm taking on Operating Systems, Cloud Computing, UI Design, and NLP. I also just wrapped up a 6-week batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), and am currently looking for internships or full-time roles beginning in Summer 2025. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: "Building a Debugger" by Sy Brand and a RAG application that uses a knowledge graph
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: my time at the Recurse Center!
